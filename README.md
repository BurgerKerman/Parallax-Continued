# Parallax Continued
Available in Early Access at [Linx's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/linx_)

## Installation Instructions

1. Download and install the required dependencies:
    - Kopernicus: https://github.com/Kopernicus/Kopernicus/releases
    - KSP Burst: https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPBurst/releases
    
2. Ensure you have downloaded the following files:
    - ParallaxContinuedEarlyAccess-Release.zip
    - Optional lifeless Eve patch - Lifeless Eve-1.0.zip
    - Optional configs for users using rescaled systems - Parallax Rescale Configs.zip

3. Browse to **ParallaxContinuedEarlyAccess-Release.zip/GameData**
4. Move **all folders** (Parallax, Parallax_StockPlanetTextures, Parallax_StockScatterTextures and Parallax_StockTerrainTextures) to **your GameData** folder
5. If you downloaded the lifeless eve patch, move '**Parallax_LifelessEvePatch**' from '**Parallax_LifelessEvePatch.zip/GameData**' to your **GameData** folder
6. If you downloaded the rescale configs, move the appropriate Parallax_Rescale_x.x folder to your GameData folder. Choose the one that matches the scale you play at

7. OPTIONAL - Delete the **Settings.cfg** file in your **Kerbal Space Program** folder. This ensures your planet configuration is clean and any junk from previous planet mods is gone.

8. Launch the game

9. **IMPORTANT - In the main menu, click 'Settings', then 'Graphics', and set 'Terrain Detail' to 'High'**

Any issues? You can reach me on Discord (linked in my Patreon description) or the KSP forums as 'Gameslinx'. I go by 'Linx' anywhere else.
