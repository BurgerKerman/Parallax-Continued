# Parallax Continued
Support development at [Linx's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/linx_)

## Installation Instructions

1. Download and install the required dependencies:
    - Kopernicus: https://github.com/Kopernicus/Kopernicus/releases
    - KSP Burst: https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPBurst/releases
    
2. Ensure you have downloaded the following files:
    - ParallaxContinued.zip
    - ParallaxContinued_StockTerrainTextures.zip
    - ParallaxContinued_StockPlanetTextures.zip
    - ParallaxContinued_StockScatterTextures.zip
    - Optional lifeless Eve patch - ParallaxContinued_LifelessEvePatch.zip

3. Browse to **ParallaxContinued.zip/GameData** and move **ParallaxContinued** to your GameData folder
4. Browse to **ParallaxContinued_StockTerrainTextures.zip/GameData** and move **Parallax_StockTerrainTextures** to your GameData folder
5. Browse to **ParallaxContinued_StockScatterTextures.zip/GameData** and move **Parallax_StockScatterTextures** to your GameData folder
6. Browse to **ParallaxContinued_StockPlanetTextures.zip/GameData** and move **Parallax_StockPlanetTextures** to your GameData folder
7. If you downloaded the lifeless eve patch, move '**ParallaxContinued_LifelessEvePatch**' from '**Parallax_LifelessEvePatch.zip/GameData**' to your **GameData** folder

8. OPTIONAL - Delete the **Settings.cfg** file in your **Kerbal Space Program** folder. This ensures your planet configuration is clean and any junk from previous planet mods is gone.

9. Launch the game

10. **IMPORTANT - In the main menu, click 'Settings', then 'Graphics', and set 'Terrain Detail' to 'High'**

NOTE: If you use Deferred, you might need to install Deferred manually (not via CKAN) if CKAN reports a conflict!
Any issues? You can reach me on Discord (linked in my Patreon description) or the KSP forums as 'Gameslinx'. I go by 'Linx' anywhere else.

## Recommended Mods
Mods that are fully compatible with and enhance the visual experience when installed with Parallax:
 - Deferred (Improves surface reflections)
 - Scatterer (Atmospheric scattering)
 - Environmental Visual Enhancements (EVE) or EVE Volumetrics (Clouds, rain)

## List of Supported Planet Packs
"Author Contacted" means not currently supported, but I've reached out to the author to help get upgrading existing configs started

**"Release 2" configs will work with Release 3**, but the orbit textures won't be improved.
